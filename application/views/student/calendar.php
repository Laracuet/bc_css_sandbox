			<p>Guest lecture by Jeff Whelpley.</p>
			<p>In a world where Google search results load instantly and hand held devices get more powerful by the day, 
				the bar for website performance is at unprecedented levels. It isn't enough that an application has cool 
				features. It has to be fast. Really fast. If you plan on working in the software industry, you need to 
				understand the basic principles of performance on the web and how to utilize tools and techniques to ensure 
				the products you create will meet customer expectations for speed. In this presentation, Jeff will introduce 
				the high level concepts, get into some real world examples, go over the process of optimization and provide a 
				vision for high performance web applications of the future.</p>
